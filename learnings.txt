-------- Data Exploration -> Data Preprocessing -> 

1) Before starting to code, always try to outline the task as a list of points and then start working on each point. We can also add interesting questions along with just correlation analysis among the input features.

2) Data Exploration: we can use the functions info(), describe() on dataframes to get a view of the input data.
    a) For numerical data: Make histograms, correlation plots(heatmaps), pivot tables.
    b) For Categorical data: Bar charts, pivot tables.

3) Split the data into numeric variables and categorical variables.
4) Plot histograms on numeric values and check whether the data is following any normal distribution.
5) correlation plots would be useful in case of regression problems.
6) Use pivot tables to check average values of different numerical features for each label.
7) Apply barplots on categorical data and observe the ratio's of categorical values. If any feature has too many distinct values then we need to simplify/reduce the data with some feature engineering techniques. 

8) If the numerical data is normally distributed then replace the missing values with the mean, otherwise with median.
9) we can use pandas get_dummies function to generate features for categorical data(similar to onehot encoding).
10) Always use k-fold cross validation for
