-------- Data Exploration -> Data Preprocessing -> 

1) Before starting to code, always try to outline the task as a list of points and then start working on each point. We can also add interesting questions along with just correlation analysis among the input features.

2) Data Exploration: we can use the functions info(), describe() on dataframes to get a view of the input data.
    a) For numerical data: Make histograms, correlation plots(heatmaps), pivot tables.
    b) For Categorical data: Bar charts, pivot tables.

3) Split the data into numeric variables and categorical variables.
4) Plot histograms on numeric values and check whether the data is following any normal distribution.
5) correlation plots would be useful in case of regression problems.
6) Use pivot tables to check average values of different numerical features for each label.
7) Apply barplots on categorical data and observe the ratio's of categorical values. If any feature has too many distinct values then we need to simplify/reduce the data with some feature engineering techniques. 

8) If the numerical data is normally distributed then replace the missing values with the mean, otherwise with median.
9) we can use pandas get_dummies function to generate features for categorical data(similar to onehot encoding).
10) Always use k-fold cross validation for improving the model performance.
11) Identify the Target and features clearly before building the model and represent with y and X respectively.
12) Basic model validation: Calculate the Mean Absolute Error to check the error in the case of regression tasks.
13) Underfitting and Overfitting are two phenomenas/scenarios where model performs poorly on training data and test data respectively.

14) We need to optimize the parameters of the model to avoid both underfitting and overfitting.
15) While optimizing consider splitting the data into train and test datasets using train_test_split and use some model validation techniques to tune hypterparameters.
16) Once the hypterparameter values are tuned then use complete train data to train the model and use that model for prediction/submission purpose.
